WorxForUsDb_Samples
===================

This sample shows how to use the WorxForUs Android framework to access a SQLite Database and shows how problems occur if using the classic approach to database access.

Prerequisites
===================
You'll need to either 
1. copy the WorxForUs library .jar file from https://github.com/RightHandedMonkey/WorxForUs_Library/blob/master/bin/worxforuslibrary.jar to your applications /lib folder and rebuild.
2. Install the source to the WorxForUs library and link as a project to the sample from https://github.com/RightHandedMonkey/WorxForUs_Library
